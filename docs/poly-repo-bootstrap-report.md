# Poly Repo Bootstrap Report

*Date: October 21, 2025*

## Overview

This report summarizes the initial audit and bootstrap operations across the PR CYBR agent repositories as part of Operation Poly Pulse. The objective is to prepare each repository for code migration from the vTOC monolithic repo by ensuring a `codex` branch, a `/plan` workflow for OpenAI Codex invocation, branch protection rules, and a minimal README.

## Actions Completed

- **FRONTEND AGENT**
  - A `codex` branch was already present.
  - Created a new workflow `.github/workflows/plan.yml` on the `codex` branch. The workflow listens to issue comments beginning with `/plan` and runs a stub script until secrets are provided.
  - Branch protection rules: not yet configured (to be done).
  - README exists; may need minor updates.
- **Other Agent Repositories**
  - Initial audit performed, but due to time constraints detailed modifications were not applied in this session. Many repositories likely already have `codex` branches and existing workflows; however, each still needs verification and installation of a `plan.yml` workflow if missing.
  - Branch protection rules for `main`, `stage`, `prod`, and `pages` need to be reviewed and configured across repositories.
  - Minimal README files should be added or updated to describe each agent’s purpose.

## Next Steps

1. **Audit remaining repositories**: Inspect each of the remaining agent repositories to confirm the existence of a `codex` branch, create it from `main` if missing, and add the `/plan` workflow file.
2. **Branch protection configuration**: Navigate to each repository’s Settings and configure branch protection rules requiring reviews and CI checks for `main`, `stage`, `prod`, and `pages`.
3. **README updates**: Add or update `README.md` in each repository to briefly describe the agent’s mission and branch roles.
4. **Secrets**: Once workflows are in place, store necessary secrets (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`) in each repository’s settings. Request user confirmation before adding secrets.
5. **Finalize report**: Update this report with detailed findings per repository (whether `codex` branch/workflow exists, branch protections configured, etc.) after completing the full audit.
