<!--
> Core Code Functions

These are the functions that the application itself can execute. They are implemented directly in the codebase and handle the operational aspects of the agent, such as:

- Dashboard Management: Handling the user interface and interactions.
- Chat Integration: Sending and receiving messages to/from OpenAI.
- Data Processing: Managing data inputs and outputs, including storage and retrieval.
- Task Coordination: Assigning and managing tasks among different agents.
- Monitoring and Reporting: Tracking progress and generating reports.

> OpenAI Functions

These functions are defined on the OpenAI platform and extend the AI assistant's capabilities. They allow the agent to perform more complex tasks by processing structured inputs and outputs, such as:

- Natural Language Processing: Understanding and generating human-like text responses.
- Data Analysis: Performing complex data analysis and providing insights.
- Decision Support: Offering recommendations based on data-driven insights.
- Incident Analysis: Evaluating incident reports and suggesting resolutions.

The OpenAI functions can be invoked by the core code functions to enhance the agent's capabilities, allowing it to perform tasks that require advanced AI processing. This setup enables a seamless integration between the operational logic of the application and the advanced AI functionalities provided by OpenAI.

<!--
Agent-Specific Functionality

1.	Dynamic Task Execution:
	•	Enable custom behaviors based on the agent’s role (e.g., PR-CYBR-FRONTEND-AGENT vs. PR-CYBR-SECURITY-AGENT).
	•	Define a configuration file or metadata to dynamically route requests to the correct handler.

2.	Internal Logging:
	•	Maintain an audit trail for all actions (e.g., received requests, completed tasks, GitHub updates).
	•	Store logs locally or in a centralized logging system for troubleshooting.

3.	Performance Metrics:
	•	Track execution time for key actions (e.g., GitHub commits, data queries).
	•	Report performance metrics to a monitoring dashboard.
-->

<!--
OpenAI Function Structure

Core Functionality

1.	Input Parsing:
	•	Accept structured inputs (e.g., JSON) from other agents, systems, or users.
	•	Validate incoming data for required fields to prevent malformed requests.

2.	Action Processing:
	•	Identify the type of request:
	•	Fetch data from the repository (e.g., logs, metadata, file content).
	•	Push updates or modifications to the repository (e.g., commits, issues, PRs).
	•	Execute agent-specific tasks (e.g., database query, frontend update, analytics computation).

3.	Communication Protocol:
	•	Handle bidirectional communication:
	•	Allow the agent to listen for requests from external systems.
	•	Enable the agent to send responses, alerts, or updates back to the source.
	•	Maintain an API or webhook-based mechanism to process real-time requests.
-->

<!--
GitHub Integration

1.	Repository Actions:
	•	Pull Data:
	•	Fetch repository metadata such as branches, commits, or tags.
	•	Download files for processing or analysis.
	•	Push Data:
	•	Create or update files in the repository programmatically.
	•	Commit changes with structured commit messages.
	•	Issues and PR Management:
	•	Create or update GitHub issues.
	•	Open or merge pull requests with detailed descriptions and reviewer assignments.

2.	Authentication:
	•	Secure integration using GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PAT) or OAuth.
	•	Ensure sensitive credentials are stored securely using .env or secrets management tools.

3.	Error Handling:
	•	Log any GitHub API errors for debugging.
	•	Retry failed API calls with exponential backoff.
-->

<!--
Outgoing Actions

	1.	Alerts and Notifications:
	•	Send status updates for successful or failed operations to external systems.
	•	Notify users or admins of critical events, such as repository updates or task completions.
	2.	Inter-Agent Communication:
	•	Allow the agent to request data or services from other agents.
	•	Use a standardized protocol (e.g., REST API or WebSocket) to ensure compatibility.
	3.	Data Export:
	•	Format data for external systems (e.g., JSON, CSV).
	•	Push processed data back to the GitHub repository or external storage.
-->

<!--
Security and Validation

	1.	Authentication:
	•	Verify incoming requests using API keys, OAuth, or token-based authentication.
	•	Ensure only authorized systems can send tasks to the agent.
	2.	Input Validation:
	•	Sanitize and validate all inputs to prevent malicious actions (e.g., injection attacks).
	3.	Rate Limiting:
	•	Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests per second or minute.
-->
