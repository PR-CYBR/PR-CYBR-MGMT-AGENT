# Orchestrator Workflow Fix - Resolution Summary

## Issue
The orchestrator workflow (`.github/workflows/maintenance.yml`) was failing on runs #49 and #48 with the error:
```
codex: not found
Process completed with exit code 127
```

## Root Cause
The workflow attempted to install a non-existent package:
```bash
pip3 install codex-cli  # This package does not exist in PyPI
```

After the failed installation, the workflow tried to execute:
```bash
echo "$EVENT_PAYLOAD" | codex analyze --output-format=json
```

Since `codex-cli` doesn't exist, the `codex` command was never installed, causing the "command not found" error.

## Resolution

### 1. Created Local Codex Implementation
Created `scripts/codex` - a Python script that provides the codex CLI functionality:
- Analyzes event payloads
- Determines which agents should be dispatched
- Returns structured JSON output
- Handles edge cases (null, empty, invalid JSON)

### 2. Updated Workflow
Modified `.github/workflows/maintenance.yml`:
- Removed the non-existent `pip3 install codex-cli` command
- Changed to use the local script: `python3 ./scripts/codex`
- Reordered steps to checkout repository before installing dependencies

### 3. Added Documentation
Created `docs/codex-cli.md` explaining:
- Usage and examples
- Event routing logic
- Integration with the workflow
- Future enhancement plans

### 4. Added Tests
Created `tests/test_codex_cli.py` with 10 comprehensive tests:
- Null/empty payload handling
- Various event types (security_alert, data_sync, maintenance, etc.)
- Invalid JSON handling
- Different output formats

## Testing Results
- ✅ All 22 tests pass (12 existing + 10 new)
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities (CodeQL scan passed)
- ✅ Code review comments addressed
- ✅ Manual testing confirms correct behavior for all scenarios

## Event Routing Logic
The stub implementation provides basic routing:
- `security_alert` → `PR-CYBR-SECURITY-AGENT`
- `data_sync` → `PR-CYBR-DATA-INTEGRATION-AGENT`
- `maintenance` or `health_check` → No agents (handled internally)
- Unknown/null events → No agents

## Expected Behavior
After this fix, the orchestrator workflow will:
1. Run successfully on scheduled triggers (daily at 02:00 UTC)
2. Analyze incoming events correctly
3. Dispatch to appropriate agents when needed
4. Handle health checks and maintenance runs gracefully (no agents dispatched)

## Files Changed
1. `scripts/codex` - New codex CLI implementation
2. `.github/workflows/maintenance.yml` - Updated workflow
3. `docs/codex-cli.md` - Documentation
4. `tests/test_codex_cli.py` - Test suite

## Next Steps
- The workflow will run successfully on the next scheduled trigger
- Monitor the workflow runs to confirm the fix works in production
- Consider enhancing the codex implementation with more sophisticated routing logic
- Add machine learning capabilities for intelligent agent selection (future)

## Notes for Future Development
This is a stub implementation that provides basic functionality. Future versions should:
- Support more event types and routing rules
- Include priority and dependency management
- Provide detailed reasoning for agent selection
- Support conditional routing based on event context
- Include machine learning for intelligent dispatching
