# OPORD-PR-CYBR-MGMT-8

## 1. OPERATIONAL SUMMARY
The objective of this OPORD is to update the PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT’s files to facilitate the loading of users into an interactive terminal program. This will be achieved by executing a setup script that utilizes TMUX to create multiple terminal windows for enhanced user interaction.

## 2. SITUATION
The PR-CYBR initiative requires modernized interaction tools to improve user experience and operational efficiency across its agents. The current interfaces need enhancement to meet the growing demands of users.

## 3. MISSION
The PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT is tasked with updating the following files:
- `src/main.py`
- `scripts/setup.sh`
- `setup.py`
- `tests/test-setup.py`
- `README.md`

These updates will include scripts to run `scripts/setup.sh`, which deploys TMUX to create four interactive terminal windows as specified.

## 4. EXECUTION

### 4.A. CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS
The main effort will involve modifying the agent’s codebase to ensure it can execute the setup script effectively, leveraging TMUX to split user terminal sessions.

### 4.B. TASKS
1. **File Updates**
   - Update `src/main.py` to initiate the script loading process.
   - Modify `scripts/setup.sh` to include commands to clone the necessary repository and set up TMUX windows as specified.
   - Adjust `setup.py` to reflect any package dependencies.
   - Enhance `tests/test-setup.py` to include tests for the new terminal functionalities.
   - Revise `README.md` to document the new terminal interactions.

2. **Implementation of TMUX**
   - Clone the aliases repository using: 
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/cywf/aliases.git
     cd aliases
     cp bash_aliases /home/$USER/.bash_aliases
     source ~/.bashrc
     cd install-scripts && chmod +x tmux-install.sh
     ./tmux-install.sh
     tmux new -s pr-cybr
     ```
   - Create the four terminal windows with specific functionalities:
     - **Window 1**: Display a welcome message and menu options, including a progress bar.
     - **Window 2**: Run `htop` for system monitoring.
     - **Window 3**: Use `tail -f` to display logs generated by the `scripts/setup.sh`.
     - **Window 4**: Display the output of `ls -l` in the repository root directory.

## 5. ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS
- Ensure all updated files are properly version-controlled and documented through Git.
- Schedule a review of the updated functionality with relevant stakeholders post-implementation.

## 6. COMMAND AND SIGNAL
- Communicate all updates and progress through the PR-CYBR communication channels.
- Ensure all agents are aware of the new functionalities for seamless integration into their workflows.

**This OPORD serves as a directive for the PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT to effectively carry out its tasks and align with the initiative’s overarching goals.**
