# OPORD for PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT

## Operation Order (OPORD) - Status Check Implementation

### 1. SITUATION
   - Current challenges include sporadic operational readiness reporting across agents, which can lead to delayed responses during critical situations. A coordinated status check is necessary to standardize reporting and improve overall agent orchestration across the PR-CYBR initiative.

### 2. MISSION
   - To trigger a comprehensive status check across all PR-CYBR agents, confirming their operational readiness and systematically identifying areas needing attention, culminating in a real-time notification of status via the Zapier webhook to Slack.

### 3. EXECUTION
#### a. Concept of Operations
   - A function within the PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT will initiate status checks, triggering workflows in all respective agent repositories to collect status reports.

#### b. Instructions
   - **Develop a function** in the PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT that:
     - Makes API calls to each agent's GitHub repository to trigger their status check workflows.
   - **Specify the API endpoints** for each agent's workflow located at:
     - `PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT`: [Link](https://github.com/PR-CYBR/PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT/tree/main/.github/workflows)
     - `PR-CYBR-CI-CD-AGENT`: [Link](https://github.com/PR-CYBR/PR-CYBR-CI-CD-AGENT/tree/main/.github/workflows)
     - `PR-CYBR-DATA-INTEGRATION-AGENT`: [Link](https://github.com/PR-CYBR/PR-CYBR-DATA-INTEGRATION-AGENT/tree/main/.github/workflows)
     - `PR-CYBR-USER-FEEDBACK-AGENT`: [Link](https://github.com/PR-CYBR/PR-CYBR-USER-FEEDBACK-AGENT/tree/main/.github/workflows)
   - **Document the expected responses** format which includes:
     - Success: Confirming operational status.
     - Fail: Indicating issues.
   - **Create logic** to aggregate responses into a comprehensive report summarizing each agent's status.
   - **Trigger the Zapier webhook** to send a real-time notification to Slack upon completion detailing the operational status of all agents.
   - **Schedule the execution** of these checks regularly using cron jobs or equivalent scheduling methods.

### 4. COORDINATION
   - Establish communication protocols to ensure all agents receive status requests and confirm responsiveness.
   - Define roles for reviewing and addressing discrepancies reported by agents during status checks.

### 5. SERVICE SUPPORT
   - Set up a support channel for troubleshooting agent responsiveness and address any operational hurdles encountered during the status check process.
   - Provide documentation and training material on the status check process for reference, making it accessible to all agents.
