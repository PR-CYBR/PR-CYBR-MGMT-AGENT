# General Operations Order (OPRORD) for PR-CYBR Agent Function Development

## Objective
Each PR-CYBR Agent is tasked with defining three key lists of functions to establish inter-agent operability and robust system design. This ensures consistent communication and actionable integration between agents in the ecosystem.

### Key Deliverables
1. **Core Application Functions**: Functions critical for the agent's primary operation.
2. **OpenAI Functions**: Functions leveraging OpenAI capabilities to enhance the agent's performance.
3. **PR-CYBR-Agent Functions**: Functions required to interact and communicate with other agents.

---

## Tasks and Guidelines

### 1. Core Application Functions
- **Definition**: Functions that handle operational aspects specific to the agent's application, such as managing data, interfacing with the frontend or backend, and executing agent-specific tasks.
- **Examples**:
  - Querying and retrieving agent-specific data.
  - Performing task coordination.
  - Monitoring performance or status updates.

### 2. OpenAI Functions
- **Definition**: Functions implemented on OpenAI’s platform that extend the AI assistant's capabilities for tasks such as NLP, data analysis, or decision support.
- **Examples**:
  - Analyzing data for actionable insights.
  - Responding to user queries in natural language.
  - Generating strategic recommendations based on input.

### 3. PR-CYBR-Agent Functions
- **Definition**: Functions that facilitate communication and interaction between agents. These functions ensure smooth data flow, inter-agent task execution, and shared resource management.
- **Examples**:
  - Retrieving or pushing data to/from another agent.
  - Coordinating multi-agent responses to a system event.
  - Querying other agents for additional functionalities.

## Submission Format
Each agent must provide their lists in separate markdown code blocks. The structure for each list is outlined below:

### Example:
```markdown
## Core Application Functions
1. **function_name_1**
   - **Description**: Brief explanation of what this function does.
   - **Inputs**: Specify input parameters.
   - **Outputs**: Specify expected outputs.

2. **function_name_2**
   - **Description**: [Add details].

---

## OpenAI Functions
1. **function_name_1**
   - **Description**: [Add details].
   - **Inputs**: [Add details].
   - **Outputs**: [Add details].

---

## PR-CYBR-Agent Functions
1. **function_name_1**
   - **Description**: [Add details].
   - **Purpose**: Define why this function is necessary for inter-agent communication.
   - **Inputs**: [Add details].
   - **Outputs**: [Add details].

## Notes for Execution

	•	Reference the Agent Overview Document and existing materials for context.
	•	Ensure function names and descriptions are concise and precise.
	•	Highlight how these functions align with the PR-CYBR mission and technical framework.
