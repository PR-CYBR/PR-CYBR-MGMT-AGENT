# Agent Documentation

This document provides detailed information about the agent's functionality, architecture, and usage, including its Docker components.

## Overview

### Agent Functionality

The `PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT` is designed to enhance cybersecurity operations by leveraging AI-powered functionalities. It integrates with the OpenAI Platform to perform strategic planning, task management, and inter-agent communication. The agent is equipped with a set of functions that facilitate efficient decision-making and resource allocation.

### Key Features

- **Strategic Planning**: Develop and refine high-level strategies for PR-CYBR initiatives, including actionable roadmaps and timelines for project milestones.

- **Coordination**: Facilitate inter-agent collaboration by assigning tasks, managing dependencies, and ensuring that all agents are aligned with PR-CYBR's mission.

- **Dashboard Chat**: Enable real-time chat functionality for users to communicate with the agent, ask questions, and receive updates on projects.

- **Monitoring and Reporting**: Track project progress and provide status updates to both agents and human users, highlighting potential issues and achievements.

- **Decision Support**: Assist in prioritizing initiatives through data analysis, risk assessments, and presenting relevant options to human users.

- **Resource Allocation**: Optimize the allocation of resources across various projects, ensuring efficient use and timely addressing of shortages.

- **Training and Awareness**: Develop and host cybersecurity training programs for both agents and the community, enhancing knowledge and awareness of best practices.

- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Manage communication and relationships with key stakeholders, collecting feedback and ensuring their involvement in PR-CYBR initiatives.

- **Incident Management**: Coordinate responses to cybersecurity incidents by facilitating communication between agents and human stakeholders for effective resolution.

- **Community Feedback**: Collect and analyze feedback from the community and users on cybersecurity needs and programs, ensuring alignment with their expectations and enhancing outreach efforts.

## Architecture

### Docker Components

The agent is containerized using Docker, which simplifies deployment and management. The following Docker components are used:

- **Dockerfile**: Defines the environment and dependencies required for the agent. It includes instructions to build the Docker image.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Manages multi-container Docker applications. It defines services, networks, and volumes for the agent.
- **Docker Hub**: The agent's Docker image is hosted on Docker Hub, allowing easy access and deployment.

### How It Works

1. **Containerization**: 
   - The agent is packaged into a Docker container, ensuring consistency across different environments. This encapsulation allows for easy deployment and scaling of the agent's functionalities.

2. **Service Definition**: 
   - The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the services required for the agent, including the main application service and any supporting services such as databases or message brokers. This setup ensures that all necessary components are orchestrated and managed efficiently.

3. **Networking**: 
   - Docker networks are configured to facilitate secure and efficient communication between containers. This setup allows agents to interact with each other, enabling cross-function calls. Each agent is assigned a unique network alias, allowing them to discover and communicate with other agents seamlessly.

4. **Volume Management**: 
   - Docker volumes are used to persist data, allowing the agent to maintain state across restarts. This ensures that critical data, such as configuration settings and operational logs, are retained and accessible.

5. **Cross-Function Calling**:

   - **Function Registry**: Each agent maintains a registry of its available functions, which are exposed via a standardized API. This registry includes metadata about each function, such as its name, parameters, and expected outputs.

   - **Inter-Agent Communication**: Agents communicate with each other using a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) or RESTful APIs. This communication layer allows agents to request and execute functions from other agents, facilitating cross-function calls.

   - **Function Invocation**: When an agent needs to call a function from another agent, it sends a request to the target agent's API, specifying the function name and required parameters. The target agent processes the request and returns the result.

   - **Security and Authentication**: Cross-function calls are secured using authentication tokens and encrypted communication channels. This ensures that only authorized agents can invoke functions and access sensitive data.

6. **Scalability and Load Balancing**:
   - The architecture supports horizontal scaling, allowing multiple instances of each agent to run concurrently. Load balancers distribute incoming requests across these instances, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.

7. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Centralized logging and monitoring tools (e.g., ELK Stack, Prometheus) are used to track the performance and health of each agent. This setup provides insights into function execution times, error rates, and resource utilization, enabling proactive management and optimization.

This architecture enables the `PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT` to efficiently collaborate with other agents, leveraging their functions to enhance overall operational capabilities. By facilitating cross-function calls, the agent can dynamically adapt to changing requirements and deliver comprehensive solutions.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the `PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT`, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PR-CYBR/PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT.git
   cd PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT
   ```

2. **Create and Configure the `.env` File**:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required values.
   - This file will store sensitive information such as API keys and database credentials.

3. **Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub**:
   - **Navigate to GitHub Settings**: Log in to your GitHub account and click on your profile picture in the top right corner. Select "Settings" from the dropdown menu.
   - **Access Developer Settings**: In the left sidebar, scroll down and click on "Developer settings."
   - **Generate a New Token**: Click on "Personal access tokens" and then "Generate new token."
   - **Configure Token Permissions**: Provide a note for the token (e.g., "PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT Access") and select the appropriate scopes. For most use cases, you might need `repo` (for repository access) and `workflow` (for GitHub Actions) scopes. Adjust the scopes based on your specific needs.
   - **Generate and Copy the Token**: Click "Generate token" at the bottom of the page. Copy the token immediately as it will not be shown again.

4. **Use the PAT as Your API Key**:
   - **Update the `.env` File**: Open the `.env` file in a text editor and add the following line, replacing `your_personal_access_token` with the token you copied:
     ```dotenv
     GITHUB_API_KEY=your_personal_access_token
     ```
   - **Secure the `.env` File**: Ensure that the `.env` file is not included in version control by adding it to your `.gitignore` file. This prevents accidental exposure of sensitive information.

5. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Use the provided `setup.py` or `local_setup.sh` script to install necessary dependencies.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ./local_setup.sh
     ```

6. **Run the Agent**:
   - Start the agent using Docker:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up
     ```
