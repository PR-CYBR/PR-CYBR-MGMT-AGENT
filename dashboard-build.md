# Outline for `Agent Dashboard `

### Deploy a Dashboard via the `PR-CYBR-[agent-name]-AGENT`'s container, that the user will be instructed on how to navigate to via browser

#### Dashboard GUI: should have a chat Interface that allow's the user the ability to chat (Input) with that Agent (via the OpenAI Assistant ID), and recieve it's (Output) response in the same window. There should be a side bar to choose to chat with other Agents (there are more / all / multiple installed and detected), if the user clicks / taps on the icon / link to chat with that Agent, it should bring the user to that containers Dashboard

#### Dashboard Core Utility: Interactive Map (using Leaflet & MapBox (with Jawg Matrix theme)), center point starting in Puerto Rico

#### Dashboard Chat UI/UX: Should popup on right side of screen (if viewing via mobile, then it should popup via the bottom) with a chat box, to interact with the Agent via Chat, while still being able to view and interact with the Interactive Map. UI/UX needs to take account for user experiance on both computer and / or mobile device

#### Dashboard Agent Sidebard: Should be Indicated top left (tapable / clickable to expand), expands as a SideBar on the left side of page
